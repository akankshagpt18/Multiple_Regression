# Multiple_Regression

We have a dataset in which we are considering Profit as the dependent variable and R&D spend, Administration, Marketing Spend and State are independent variable and how much money has been spent on each category and the location of the company. So we are building a model that will help the investor in identifying the type of company that it should invest in. Also which company is performing better based on location or expenditure amount.
